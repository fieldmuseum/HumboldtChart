We surveyed three camps, spending four full days and parts of three days at Mina de Sal (15 – 18 September 2013), six full days and parts of two days at Alto Cachiyacu (21 – 26 September) and two full days and parts of three days at Alto Cahuapanas (28 – 29 September). At Mina de Sal we covered an elevational range of 300 – 700 m, at Alto Cachiyacu 500 – 1,950 m, and at Alto Cahuapanas 1,000 – 1,350 m. Stotz, Saboya, and Ruelas spent 92 hours observing birds at Mina de Sal, 148 hours at Alto Cachiyacu, and 61 hours at Alto Cahuapanas. Due to the extensive elevational range surveyed at Alto Cachiyacu, we stayed at two satellite camps above the main base camp, one at 1,200 m and another at 1,950 m. Each of us spent a single night at each of the two satellite camps. Elevations between 1,300 and 1,950 m received 33 hours of coverage, while those between 900 and 1,300 m received 17.5 hours of coverage. The remainder of our fieldwork was focused on the lower slopes from 500 to 900 m, and totaled 97.5 hours. Thus, despite the access to high elevations the lower slopes were much better surveyed. Our protocol consisted of walking trails looking and listening for birds. We mainly conducted our surveys separately to increase independent-observer effort, but Saboya and Stotz spent a day together at Mina de Sal, and Ruelas and Saboya were in the field together one day at Mina de Sal and one day at Alto Cachiyacu. Typically, we departed camp before first light and remained in the field until mid-afternoon. On some days we returned to the field 1 – 2 hours before sunset. We tried to cover all the habitats near each camp. At every campsite the entire trail system was walked at least once by a member of the bird team; most trails were surveyed multiple times. Total distances walked by each observer each day varied from 4 to 15 km depending on trail length, habitat, density of birds, and condition of the observer. Trails were generally steep, with extensive changes in elevation across short distances. Ruelas carried a Marantz PMD661 digital recorder and a Sennheiser ME66 shotgun microphone to document species and confirm identifications with playbacks. Saboya and Ruelas also carried iPods with reference vocalization collections to aid field identification. All observers kept daily records of numbers of each species observed, and compiled these records during a round-table meeting each evening. Observations by other members of the inventory team supplemented our records. The bird team also focused on recording the elevational distributions of all species observed at each of the three camps. Each of us used a Garmin 60CSX GPS unit to obtain elevations for our bird records. In Appendix 10, we provide elevational ranges for all species observed in each camp. Elevations are rounded to the nearest 50 m. For example, a bird seen between 625 and 675 m would be recorded as 650 m. Many species were seen in only a single elevational interval and these appear in Appendix 10 with a single elevation. Otherwise, we give the lowest and highest elevations at which a species was observed. Our complete list of species in Appendix 10 follows the taxonomy, sequence, and nomenclature (for scientific and English names) of the South American Checklist Committee of the American Ornithologists’ Union, version 23 September 2013 (http://www.museum.lsu. edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.html). In Appendix 10 we estimate relative abundances using our daily records. Because our visits to these sites were short, our estimates are necessarily crude and may not reflect bird abundance or presence during other seasons. For the three inventory sites, we used four abundance classes. ‘Common’ (C) indicates birds observed (seen or heard) daily in substantial numbers (averaging 10 or more birds per day). ‘Fairly common’ (F) indicates that a species was seen daily but represented by fewer than 10 individuals per day. ‘Uncommon’ (U) birds were those encountered more than twice at a camp but not seen daily, and ‘Rare’ (R) birds were observed only once or twice at a camp as single individuals or pairs. Because of the shorter survey periods at Alto Cahuapanas and at elevations above 900 m at Alto Cachiyacu, the abundance estimates are even less precise than those for Mina de Sal and the lower elevations at Alto Cachiyacu. We compared our results to those of other rapid inventories that focused on Andean tepuis. From north to south these are: Cofan-Bermejo (Schulenberg 2002), Kampankis (Ruelas Inzunza et al. 2012), Cordillera Azul (Schulenberg et al. 2001), Sierra del Divisor (Schulenberg et al. 2006), and Megantoni (Lane and Pequeño 2004). We also compared our data to those from Sira and Pantiacolla in central and southern Peru respectively; from Davis (1986), whose 1,350 – 1,450 m field site was only 20 km south of our Alto Cachiyacu camp; and from Parker and Parker (1982), Schulenberg and Awbrey (1997), and Robbins et al.

The main sites ranged from 280 to 1,028 m, but limited sampling was also directed to higher-elevation sites (1,200 and 1,920 m) adjacent to the second site and along the trail systems adjoining these different camps. Information on globally threatened species was taken from IUCN (2013) and from CITES (2005). Information on the categorization of threatened species by the Peruvian government was taken from MINAG (2004). Medium and large mammals We utilized both direct observations and a variety of indirect evidence to register medium- and largebodied mammals. Indirect observations included tracks and other signs of mammal activity, including vocalizations, food or feeding remains, feces, wallows, dens, and scratches on trees. Dedicated searches for larger mammals took place over seven days and 36 km in all three main camps: two days at the Mina de Sal campsite (300 – 700 msnm), three days at Alto Cachiyacu (500 – 1,950 m), and two days at Alto Cahuapanas (1,000 – 1,400 m). Searches for mammals took place along trails up to 9 km in length that were purposefully constructed to access most available habitats. We walked trails at a rate of ca. 1 km/h between 08:00 and 17:00, looking for footprints and other signs in the trail or on its margins, on the banks and edges of rivers and streams, and along game trails. In some cases, it was necessary to leave the trail to confirm mammal identifications. Wherever possible, records were captured and archived photographically. Identification of animal signs to genus or species utilized personal experience as well as Emmons and Feer (1997) and Tirira (2007). In addition, all members of the biological team recorded incidental encounters with mammals and these supplemented our records. Daytime observations were made mainly by ornithologists, botanists, and ichthyologists conducting their own surveys between 06:00 and 17:00. Nocturnal records were gathered by mammalogists monitoring mist nets along trails or by herpetologists scouring the forest for amphibians and reptiles. Both groups were most active in the period 18:00 – 22:30 but observations extended to 03:00 – 04:00 on occasion. Incidental records were supplemented by eight observations made by the advance team while actually cutting the trails (22 August – 22 September 2013). We interviewed local assistants at Mina de Sal and Alto Cachiyacu using the Rapid Color Guide ‘Mamíferos Grandes de Loreto, Perú’ (Leite Pitman 2012). They identified species thought to be present in the Cordillera Escalera and indicated the Shawi names for the animals. Small mammals We evaluated the bat faunas of Cordillera Escalera during most nights of the inventory using mist nets. Mist nets (combinations of four 6-m nets and eight 12-m nets) were placed on the ground in various habitats (e.g., primary forest, secondary forest, riparian forest, over streams and other bodies of water) and potentially preferred microsites (e.g., below flowering or fruiting trees, forest clearings, and across trails). Sampling effort each night was scaled inversely by capture rates, precipitation, and moonshine, and directly by habitat suitability (i.e., larger, straighter trails with more open understories conducive to bat flight). Nets were opened each night at dusk and closed after 3 – 6 hours. Nets were closed early when rain or moonlight reduced the likelihood of captures; they remained open until pre-dawn in higher-elevation forests where we recorded fewer captures. The effort used to sample bats was quantified by the length of nets deployed (in m, each meter of length corresponding to approximately 2 m2 in area), multiplied by the number of hours they were open. Mist nets were deployed on 12 nights during the survey (four at Mina de Sal, five at Alto Cachiyacu, and three at Alto Cahuapanas), for a total of 4377 meter-hours (m-h) of sampling. An average night of netting had 364.7 m-h (range = 33 – 945, SD = 242.5), corresponding to five 12-m nets open from dusk until midnight. Efforts were also made at the Mina de Sal and Alto Cachiyacu campsites to sample non-volant mammals using mouse and rat traps. Up to 40 Woodstream Museum Special and 12 Victor rat traps were baited with a peanut butter-oatmeal mixture and placed along trails in alternating sequence at 5 – 10 m intervals in favorable microsites for small mammal activity. Given very rapid depletion of baits by ants and roaches (often within two hours!), baits were sometimes wrapped in cheesecloth before being deployed on bait pedals; these ‘bait balls’ slowed but did not stop bait depletion. In the interests of maximizing data collection, no traps were set at the final campsite. Sampling effort (measured in trap-nights) was 108 for Mina de Sal, 93 for Alto Cachiyacu base camp, 44 for Alto Cachiyacu intermediate camp, 104 for Alto Cachiyacu summit camp, and none for Alto Cahuapanas. We analyzed our data using pivot tables and histograms in Microsoft Excel 2010. We conducted linear and non-linear regressions, Pearson product-moment correlations, and principal components analyses (based on correlations of the presence-absence matrix) using Statistica v.7.1 (StatSoft 2005).",Perú: Cordillera Escalera-Loreto' https://doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.100199,,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,TRUE,B.
